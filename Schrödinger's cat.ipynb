    "The story of Schrödinger's cat, a cat that through some quantum physics magic is simultaneously alive and dead, has become engrained in popular culture and many popular science articles. But as the physics has become popularized, misconceptions have been introduced into the story. When you Google \"Schrodinger's cat\" the following definition appears: \"a cat imagined as being enclosed in a box with a radioactive source and a poison that will be released when the source (unpredictably) emits radiation, the cat being considered (according to quantum mechanics) to be simultaneously both dead and alive until the box is opened and the cat observed.\" The notion that a cat can be both alive and dead at the same time is counterinuitive and, most importantly, completely false. I propose a thought experiment that demonstrates that the popular conception of a half-living cat is impossible."
