    "There exists a belief found in popular culture as well as many popular science articles that the famous Schrödinger's cat experiment suggests that cats can be both alive and dead at the same time. This is so common that when you Google \"Schrodinger's cat\" the following definition appears: \"a cat imagined as being enclosed in a box with a radioactive source and a poison that will be released when the source (unpredictably) emits radiation, the cat being considered (according to quantum mechanics) to be simultaneously both dead and alive until the box is opened and the cat observed.\" I propose an experiment which demonstrates that this is an unsatisfactory explanation, and that at no time is a cat both alive and dead."
