    "There has been increased interest recently in exploring voting systems beyond the first-past-the-post (FPTP) system so common in US elections. Perhaps the most popular alternative is ranked-choice voting. Although I prefer ranked-choice voting to FPTP, I think there are many problems with this system that warrant looking for a different system. In this post, I argue the case against ranked-choice voting, pointing out that it has many properties that are undesirable for a voting system.\n",
    "\n",
    "This post discusses these problems in theoretical elections. In the following post, I talked about how these can or have happened in real elections. In a third post, I will discuss approval voting and how that remedies many of the issues with ranked-choice voting."

    "Ranked-choice voting, also known as instant runoff voting, is a voting system where voters rank their choice of candidates. The vote counting consists of multiple rounds where the vote totals are counted. If no candidate wins the majority of the votes after a round, candidates with the least votes are eliminated and the votes then go to the next candidate on the ranked ballot. Thus it is like having an instant runoff election, which is why this process is also known as instant runoff voting. There are lots of variations to this general approach (like how many candidates to remove each round), but this is the general idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proponents of ranked-choice voting, such as [FairVote](https://www.fairvote.org/) make many claims about the benefits of ranked-choice voting. They claim that it reduces strategic voting, provides more choice because voters don't have to worry about vote splitting, and prevents 3rd-party candidates from \"spoiling\" an election.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, I don't think all these claims are true. Many of these negative effects still happen with ranked-choice voting. I want to be clear that I think ranked-choice voting is far better than first-past-the-post voting, but it still can be improved on. In particular, my preferred voting style is approval voting, which I will talk about in another post."
